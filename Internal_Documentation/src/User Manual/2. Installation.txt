Title: Installation

Where to get ssGUI?::
You can get ssGUI on GitHub by this link. [Insert Link]

You can import ssGUI either by

- Using pre-built binaries [TODO]
- Building ssGUI from source via CMake. [Linux support only. You will have to build SFML yourself on Windows and Mac for the time being.]

How to build ssGUI instead of using binary?::

*Caution!!*
> The release version of SFML WILL NOT work on ssGUI as it requires the GitHub version of SFML.

> Right now, only the Linux version of the SFML library is present. If you want to build ssGUI for Windows or Mac, you will have to build SFML first.

Run CMake by pointing the source folder to "src" folder and binary folder to "builds" folder. CMake GUI is recommended.

If you want to switch to dynamic library, go to src/CMakeLists.txt and change the OUTPUT_STATIC to FALSE

[TODO: Refine this part]

How do I import ssGUI into my project?::
You can find /include in the zip file. You just need to add it as one of the include path in your project.

In CMake, you just need to
> target_include_directories(ssGUI PUBLIC "[Path to include directory]")

_

Then, you just need to link the static/dynamic library files to your project.

In CMake, you just need to follow
