Title: Extension Class

Extension class provides a way to add functionality to a GUI object without modifying it.

Some extensions are general extensions that can be applied to all if not most of the GUI objects. 

Others are specific extensions that can only be applied to a specific type of GUI objects.

You can tell by the name of an extension or by reading the documentation associated to it.

Similar to event callbacks, you need to create it on the heap.

> ssGUI::Extensions::Border* border = new ssGUI::Extensions::Border();

_

To add it to a GUI object, you can just call <GUIObject::AddExtension>

> int extensionIndex = someObject.AddExtension(border);

which returns an extension index you can use to remove the extension.

> someObject.RemoveExtension(extensionIndex);

_

Similar to event callbacks, you can get an extension by using the name of the extension type by calling <GUIObject::GetExtension>

If you have any questions on how a particular extension works, it is normally documented in that extension class.
