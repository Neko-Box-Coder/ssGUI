Title: 👟 Getting Started

Section: 🗄️ What makes up ssGUI:

In ssGUI, you will often see the following objects:

- *GUI objects*

- *Extensions* provide additional functionality to a GUI object. This can be in the form of visual changes, logic changes, or both.

- *Event Callbacks* provides callback on different GUI events

- *ssGUIManager* for orchestrating all the GUI objects



Section: 🛳️ Objects Ownership:

- <ssGUI::ssGUIManager> manages --> *GUI Objects* manage --> *Extensions* and *Event Callbacks* (as long as they are attached)

- If an object is created on the stack, it must remain valid until nothing uses it

Don't worry, this will become clear once we dive into different examples.
